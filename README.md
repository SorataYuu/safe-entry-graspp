# Safe Entry for GraSPP

This is a Flutter-based Web App developed as a Check In system for the Graduate School of Public Policy, University of Tokyo Student Lounge. It was developed over a week-long period. The backend uses Firebase.

While the name is inspired by the same system in Singapore, this project has absolutely no relations to the one in Singapore. 

The project allowed students to scan a QR code at the entrance to the lounge, login with Google and then choose which room they were using in order to "check in". 

Do note that as the project was developed on short-notice, the code was not properly cleaned or commented.
